"""The unified per-window ledger — ONE source of truth for skip + retry + visibility.

DEC-WINDOW-LEDGER-001. Today the spot/options pull keeps the per-window state in
TWO stores that must agree but are wired so the WRONG one drives the skip:

* :class:`~brutex.data.fetch_coverage.FetchCoverage` — a flat *set* of completed
  windows. This is what the ingest probes to skip a vendor call, but it is
  populated COARSELY (the dataset min/max span enclosing a window), so an
  internal-gap ``FAILED`` window is marked "complete" and skipped forever
  (the #598 bug).
* :class:`~brutex.data.window_status.WindowStatusLog` — the PRECISE
  ``SUCCESS``/``EMPTY``/``FAILED`` record. Visibility only; it does not drive the
  skip.

This module is the unification: ONE ledger that records EVERY planned window
(``PLANNED`` at pull start, then the landed outcome) and IS the authority for the
skip decision — a window is skipped **only** if its row is settled
(``SUCCESS``/``SKIPPED``); any ``FAILED``/``PLANNED``/``EMPTY``-below-threshold or
MISSING window is fetched. So a window can never be silently masked: the skip
falls out of the primary record instead of a coarse derived set patched every
pull (#597/#598).

This file is the PURE, in-memory model (PR-1 of the staged rollout): the durable
DuckDB/Parquet backing + the pull wiring land in later slices
(``window_ledger_store`` / the ingest switch). Every mutate / read is **O(1)**
under one lock (DEC-DHAN-PARALLEL-INGEST-001 — one ledger is threaded into every
parallel window worker); the snapshot is O(N) over the recorded windows.
